<h1>Phase 0, Week 3</h1>
<h2>My Mind and Learning Style</h2>
<h4>January 11, 2015</h4>

<section>
Anthony Gregorc, Ph.D. is a world-reknowned researcher in the field of learning styles.  <a href="web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.html">This website</a> enumerates his Mind Styles model, but I will briefly summarize it.  Each person has either a concrete or abstrect perceptual quality, and a sequential or random ordering ability.  Combined, these yield four combinations of the strongest of these qualities: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Random, Abstract Sequential, and Concrete Random.  I took <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this quiz</a> to determine my thinking style, and came out as an Abstract Sequential Mind.  

The Abstract Sequential Mind is one that uses logic to problem solving, and prefers to analyze situations before jumping into them.  This type of mind also benefits from having references, and working alone to solidify concepts.  They have difficulty applying emotion to situations, and with emotional expression.  Repetition and rules are also things that come across as difficult.  This seems pretty accurate to my own observations.  I definitely like to do my research and know everything possible about a situation before going into it.  I think the fact that I am not very diplomatic may be a challenge if I work with those who I disagree with.  

So far in Phase 0, my biggest struggle has mostly been getting into the working mindset.  I have not had a job in almost a year, and just getting into a normal schedule has been a little tougher than I thought.  Three (five) weeks in, I think this is finally coming to a resolution, as this week I felt I managed my time extremely well: fitting in a GPS session and three peer pairs into a busy week of wedding festivities for my brother.  Last week I was working up to the last minute on everything, but this week I have kept up on my work and am set to finish well before midnight.

Another thing to keep in mind while assessing my learning strategies and styles is the difference between a Growth and Fixed mindset.  I've definitely fallen to the pitfalls of a Fixed mindset before, like being threatened by other people's success.  I need to be cognizant of this and actively attack those thoughts to change them.  I have tried to challenge myself as much as possible during this as well.  I definitely want to move fully into a growth mindset as Phase 0 continues.
