<h2>Tech Problems: Moore's Law</h2>
<h4>January 18, 2015</h4>

<section>
Have you ever noticed that whenever you buy a new computer, laptop, or phone, it's pretty much obsolete a month after it comes out?  In 1965 (yeah, computers are that old), Gordon Moore of Intel wrote about this strange trend in a research paper.  He noticed that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years.  The number of transistors is directly proportional to the computing power of the device.  This trend is known as "Moore's Law," and has upheld since it was first published in 1965.  This kind of exponential growth is great until you think about the fact that the size of a chip is limited.  If we limit the size of the chip, we have to halve the size of the transistors every two years.  Eventually, we will reach a lower limit where we simply cannot make a smaller transistor and will effectively cap out processing power at that point.  Scary huh?

What can we do about this?  There are a few proposed solutions.  For now, we can keep our current manufacturing processes, but they will eventually fail once we reach the atomic limit on the size of our style of transistor.  To avoid this, new types of transistors, or even computing will need to be developed.  Once transistors reach a quantum scale (about 5nm or so), quantum effects like quantum tunneling (electrons moving through a barrier) become relevant and could cause errors if an electron tunnels through a transistor gate.  The smallest theoretical transistor would be on which either contains an electron (on) or does not (off).  Other interesting solutions include using small biological molecules as logical transistors.
