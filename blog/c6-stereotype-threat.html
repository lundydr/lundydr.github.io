<h1>Phase 0, Week 6</h1>
<h2>Stereotype Threat and DBC</h2>
<h4>February 1, 2015</h4>

<p>
Stereotype threat is defined as the anxiety that one feels when in a social situation where one feels they may confirm a negative stereotype about their social group.  Most commonly, this applies to race and sex, and can have very real effects, such as lower test scores and other performance gaps.  The effect is most pronounced when attention is drawn to the group or stereotype.  I have never personally had the displeasure of experiencing racial or sexual stereotype threat, but I have felt social anxiety while playing sports as a young boy.  I considered myself to be one of the nerdier kids, and the stereotype is nerds are no good at sports.  Consequently, when I played sports I tried to put myself in a position of as little importance as possible on the team so I wouldn't blow it for everyone.  I know its rather minor in the grand scheme of things, but in some way it's relatable.</p>

<p>Now that I am more aware of this sad phenomenon, I can better prepare myself to help others cope with it.  If I see a fellow student or co-worker I feel is falling victim to stereotype threat, I will do my best to let them know what a welcoming environment they are in and that nobody is viewing them through a negative stereotypical lens.  It is probably a very touchy subject, so I would not try to be overt about it unless confided in.  I would, however, strive to make everyone in the group feel welcomed and appreciated.  If someone has complained to me of specific instances of feeling stereotype threat, I would make an effort to help prevent such situations from arising by talking to the offending party or taking measures to avoid such situations.</p>
