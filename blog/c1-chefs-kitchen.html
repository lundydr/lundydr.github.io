<h1>Phase 0, Week 1</h1>
  <h2>Kitchen vs Restaurant, and the learning environment at DBC</h2>
  <h4>December 14, 2014</h4>

      I found Shereef's fireside chat video, and especially the idea of the kichen vs restaurant mindset very intriging.  These two mindsets are basically a consumer mindset (restaurant) and a creator mindset (kitchen).  At a restaurant, we come in as a consumer and expect a certain experience at a price.  However, as a chef in a kitchen, we become the creator, and take ownership of the enviroment and what is being produced.  I had never thought about how much my perspective on experiences was viewed through the lens of a consumer.  Personally, I was apalled a bit, but I am excited to spend more time in a creative, collaborative environment, such as DBC's "kitchen.""

      Another thing that resonated with me were the two fears.  I've often worried that I would be the dumbest person in the room when going to an event with large amounts of people.  It's never actually been the case for me, but I still worry about it.  It is nice to know that the staff and other students in my cohort will be coming in with the same sorts of fears, ready to conquer them and take control of the time in San Fransico.  I am looking forward to the rest of Phase 0, and I can't wait to actually head out to California for Phase 1!
