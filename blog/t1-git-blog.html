  <h1>Phase 0, Week 1</h1>
    <h2>Command Line, git, and github galore.</h2>
    <h4>December 14, 2014</h4>
    <p>
       Today marks the end of the first week of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0.For me this week has been exciting.  I've been looking forward to getting started ever since I first got in.  This week, our training focused on the basics of using the command line, and a crash course on git and GitHub.  We also learned the very important concept of version control.  What is version control?  Well, it's pretty much just like it sounds.  You've seen program version numbers all over the place your entire computer career.  Basically, version control allows developers to package a group of changes into a commit, and then add all these changes at once to the program, changing the version number to keep track.  This might not seem like a big deal, but in a project involving multiple developers, rampant changes could lead to code deletions, and just about any kind of error you can imagine.  By using commits to only add stable bits of code into the overall program, you can avoid errors and keep everyone mostly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
        So now that you're familiar with version control, how exactly do we DO it?  One of the ways is to use software known as git.  One of git's most powerful features is the branch system.  By using something called a branch, developers can fork (make a copy of) the master branch of the code, and play around with it in an isolated sandbox.  This way individual developers can add changes to the code independently.  Once a developer is happy with the changes, they can use git to commit the changes and push them to the other developers.  Git will even merge the changes into the main code for you, it's just that simple!
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay, you say, I get git, but where do I actually share my code with other developers?  Why you just navigate to GitHub.com, and sign up of an account.  GitHub is essentially a web-based version of git.  You can browse branches, fork them into your own repositories (directories), and edit the files.  Although, you'll want to use the command line to do these things because it's MUCH faster once you get used to it.  By using GitHub, many developers can work together from any remote location and still collaborate effectively.
