  <h1>Phase 0, Week 9</h1>
    <h2>HTML and CSS revisited: Site redisgn #1.</h2>
    <h4>February 22, 2015</h4>
    <p>This week, one of my assignments was to overhaul my personal website and make it more presentable, and also show off new things I've learned.  I had a pretty good idea for a new layout for my site, so I drew a wireframe for both the blog template and the main index.  I then wrote the HTML, and edited my old default.css file to match my new tags.  I decided to keep the color scheme the same for time's sake.  Redesigning the main page and the new navigation bars were easy, but it was a pretty big pain to apply all of the new HTML to all the old blog articles!  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  I also did not experiment with adding a framework to my site for time's sake.  In a future redesign I will probably implement this if it makes sense to do so.  I asked one of my new housemates who is a graphical designer for some feedback on the structure and color, and will be using some of his color advice in the future.  The other person I asked to review the site had the idea of having the blog timeline on each blog page as well, and I have implemented that already.  Overall, this process was more time-consuming than I expected, but I am satisfied with the new version of my site!</p>
