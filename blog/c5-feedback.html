<h1>Phase 0, Week 5</h1>
<h2>Peer Pairing and Feedback</h2>
<h4>January 25, 2015</h4>

<section>
One of the core experiences of Phase 0 has been Peer Pairing and GPS sessions.  For those of you who are not familiar with these, DBC students typically have a mandatory group challenge each week, in addition to a Guided Pairing Session (GPS) with a DBC alum or faculty sitting in.  These Peer Pairing sessions allow us to practice working with others in a positive, respectful way, as well as to help each other learn the cirriculum.  Each week, I find my Peer Pairing sessions to be pretty efficient at problem solving, and only once have we been so stumped we took a small break to reframe our thoughts.  I am typically someone who likes to work alone and at my own pace, so it surprised me how much I enjoyed these.  One thing I noticed about myself in college was that I love teaching others things, and the Peer Pairing sessions often give me chances to share my knowledge!  At times it can be frustrating if not all members of the group are on the same page as far as learning goes, but I have not actually experienced many issues.

After pairing with each other, we then submit Actionable, Specific, and Kind (A.S.K.) feedback to each other via a web interface.  Each week, we also anonymously rate other's feedback to make sure they fit the A.S.K. model.  When giving feedback, I often have many positive things to say about the person, but have trouble finding something for them to improve.  I suppose I should be a bit more critical in the future so I can help others learn better.  I have found the experience of reading feedback a bit nerve-wracking, because I am worried about negative feedback.  Most of the feedback I've recieved so far has been positive and constructive, so my worries have been for naught.  Based on my feedback, I am going to make a conscious effort to be as prepared as possible before each of my sessions in order to maximize our productivity as a unit.
