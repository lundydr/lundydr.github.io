<h1>Phase 0, Week 7</h1>
<h2>My values</h2>
<h4>February 8th, 2015</h4>

<section>
When I think of the times in my life I have been the most proud or satisfied, they tend to come after some kind of achievement I have been working towards for a long time, such as a graduation.  Other times, my family relationships have lifted me up and kept me going.  The last two big values in my life are independence, and helping others.  I take a lot of pride in being able to do things on my own, and also in being able to share that knowledge with others.

When people ask me for advice, most commonly it is in the academic sense.  This directly relates back to one of my core values of helping others, because it allowed me to share my knowledge with someone else and help them get to a good solution.  

When I think about these values, I begin to recall times when they have been important to me.  Recalling my past successes, along with the hardships faced in achieving them, should help mitigate negative stereotype threat if I begin to feel it.  I can also reach out to my family for some cheer.
